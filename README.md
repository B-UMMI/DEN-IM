# DEN-IM

A user-friendly, containerized and reproducible workflow for the analysis of dengue virus sequencing data, 
both from metagenomic or targeted sequencing methodologies.

As input DEN-IM accepts *raw paired-end Illumina sequencing reads*, both from metagenomic or targeted approaches,
and provides the user with an interactive HTML report. It's  implemented in Nextflow alongside Docker containers to 
facilitate installation and can be executed in local machines or high performance computing facilities.
